# Walls, Doors, Floors and Cabinets and Fixtures Phase 1

When generating dust from demo, drywall etc., seal the HVAC indoor unit to
protect heat exchanger.

## Walls

1. We're planning to do interior painting ourselves, so any drywall work, etc.
   should leave the walls primer ready. Please leave the floor covered with
   protective paper.
2. Please include baseboard trim, as appropriate, in the rooms where the floor
   is replaced.
3. Remove wall sconces and gang boxes in BR#1 and BR#2. Patch and finish holes.
4. Add backsplash above counter and stove throughout kitchen. Backsplash should
   not extend into Living Room—i.e., around the corner from the kitchen.

   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

   Edge trim will be needed for the exposed ends in the living room and by the
   pantry window.

5. Remove stub wall beside refrigerator.
6. Move refrigerator cubicle back to front door. Leave room for front
   door-knob.
7. Remove and patch dryer vent in kitchen.
8. Remove penetration, seal and finish wall.
9. Remove and seal current stove exhaust vent. Repair roof at vent location or
   should we retain the roof exhaust as an attic vent and minimize roof
   repairs?
10. Add stove vent above new stove location. Small rectangular vent pipe to
    minimize cupboard impact desired.

    We have already purchased Zephyr Breeze II Model AK1200W 30 inch, hood vent.

    - [Hood User Manual](http://docs.zephyronline.com/docs/manuals/breeze_manual.pdf "Hood User Manual")

11. Two magnetic knife strips are mounted on the existing cabinet. Please mount
    one each side on the upper cabinets, to either side of the sink.
12. Replace drywall in kitchen.
13. Remove wire raceway in ceiling between kitchen and living room and between
    bathroom and hall. Bathroom ceiling remain unfinished in Phase 1.
14. Fill patch and tape kitchen and living room walls as needed.
15. In living room and BR#2, tape, mud and finish ceiling. Semi-smooth finish.
16. Do we need to cover kitchen, living room and BR#2 ceiling with drywall?
    Currently WW2 era plywood.
17. Do we need to drywall BR#2 walls? Currently WW2 era plywood.

Except for replacing bathroom door with pocket door and removing the raceway,
bathroom changes are [Phase 2](#phase-2-remodel).

### Water Heater Relocation

The water heater is behind a truss, which is 7'4" from attic door and the door
is 12 ft. from the front of the house to the nearest edge of attic door. Dimensions
are from the exterior of the house. The approximate location has been added to
[the View Home button](#overview).

Since there is adequate clearance for the hood vent over the stove, the water
heater does not need to be relocated.

### Crawl Space Plumbing

1. Replace heat tape and insulate pipes as needed. Add additional heat tape to
   unprotected sections if any. Heat tape in crawl space is old, so replace
   with new. Let me know if the lifetime is less than 5 years.
2. Do we need to replace the cast-iron drain? I assume ABS is recommended for
   the drains. Please advise.
3. I assume PEX is the best choice for supply plumbing. Please don't re-use existing
   copper pipe.

## Doors

### Bathroom Door

1. Raise door jamb close to ceiling.
2. Replace door with pocket door. Frosted glass or similar synthetic material
   is desired to allow natural light into hall.
3. If necessary for pocket door installation, replace the cabinets, top and
   bottom, with a pantry/closet.

## Floors

Remove tile floor:

- Kitchen
- Living Room
- Hallway
- Bedroom #2

Do not remove floor in Bathroom, which is deferred to
[Phase 2](#phase-2-remodel).

Add water-resistant flooring similar to BR#1 bamboo to living room and kitchen.
Bamboo flooring is acceptable for living room and hall. Include insulating
underlayment.

TAS Bourbon Street Applewood LOLG1039 matches well with BR#1 and current
counter, backsplash and cabinet selections.

## Cabinets and Fixtures

### Kitchen Cabinets and Fixtures

1. For the kitchen counter, we like Latte Quartz from _SBN Marble Granite
   & Tile, Inc._.
2. Relocate washer water supply to refrigerator cubicle. Remove washer drain.
   <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
3. We have purchased the [NORRSJÖN Sink, stainless steel](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S49157914/?query=NORRSJ%C3%96N "NORRSJÖN").

   > TODO: <17-11-18, JD Fisher>
   > > Decide whether to under-mount.

   The sink includes fittings necessary for top mounting but may also be
   under-mounted. The sink also includes the drain fittings but does not
   include pipe and fittings needed to connect the drain line. The existing
   piping is setup for two sink drains and a dishwasher drain; the new sink has
   only one.

4. [VIMMERN Kitchen faucet with handspray, stainless steel color](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10305289/ "VIMMERN")
   is installed in the existing kitchen sink. Please re-use the faucet.
   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
5. Add faucet and drain for stove. Drain should be capped for future use by a
   steam injecting oven. Faucet should have a pull-out nozzle that reaches
   front of stove for filling large pressure canner (13 inch height).
   Only cold water plumbing is needed.

   Find cheaper alternative. See Issue #4.

6. Add appliance garage near preparation area for 5-qt Kitchen-Aid mixer,
   blender and food processor. Garage should have fold away door, so that
   counter space is accessible when the garage is open.
7. Lower corner cupboard, near sink, should have a lazy-susan or pull out
   shelving so that maximum space can be accessed.
8. Double lower cupboards should have pull out shelves, adjustable height if
   practical. Sink cupboard should have pull out shelves that work around the
   plumbing.
9. Spice drawers adjacent to the dishwasher are desired.
10. Dovetail drawer fronts are desired.
11. Installation cutout drawings are available for the dishwasher, stove and
    refrigerator.

    Size refrigerator cubicle for standard 36 inch; actual refrigerator is
    smaller.

    > > Decide how to conceal the empty space. Work with Huntwood to design
    > > a door that could be removed if we end up with a larger refrigerator
    > > later.

12. Relocate dishwasher and sink per drawing. Update plumbing accordingly.
13. Minimize sink drain obstruction in cabinet. The IKEA plumbing fittings work
    well. Also, the drain guard should be removable: IKEA has a threaded one.
14. Relocate and replace irrigation control, outside, near the crawl space
    access. It should plug into the crawl space heat tape outlet.

### Bedroom #2 Cabinets and Fixtures

1. BR#2 will be used as a laundry room and smoking lounge.
2. Add a high flow, very low noise ceiling exhaust fan for controlling humidity
   and exhausting smoke.
3. Add dryer vent
4. Add washer water supply and drain.
5. Installation drawings for washer and dryer are available showing recommended
   water supply, drain and dryer vent locations.
