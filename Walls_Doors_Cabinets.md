# Walls, Doors and Cabinets and Fixtures

## Walls

1. We're planning to do interior painting ourselves, so any drywall work, etc. should leave the walls primer ready. Please leave the floor covered with protective paper.
2. Please include baseboard trim, as appropriate, in the rooms where the floor is replaced.
3. Remove wall sconces and gang boxes in BR#1 and BR#2. Patch and finish holes.
4. Add backsplash above counter and stove throughout kitchen. Some possibilities:
    1. [Greecian White Arabesque 12 in. x 12 in. x 10 mm Polished Marble Mesh-Mounted Mosaic Floor and Wall Tile (10sq.ft./case)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/MSI-Greecian-White-Arabesque-12-in-x-12-in-x-10-mm-Polished-Marble-Mesh-Mounted-Mosaic-Floor-and-Wall-Tile-10sq-ft-case-GRE-AREBESQ/205762446 "Home Depot Tile Backsplashes") Model # GRE-AREBESQ Internet #205762446 Store SO SKU #1001231000
    2. [Calacatta Cressa Leaf 12 in. x 12 in. x 10 mm Honed Marble Mesh-Mounted Mosaic Tile (10 sq. ft. / case)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/MSI-Calacatta-Cressa-Leaf-12-in-x-12-in-x-10-mm-Honed-Marble-Mesh-Mounted-Mosaic-Tile-10-sq-ft-case-CALCRE-LEAFH/301165224 "Home Depot Tile Backsplashes") Model # CALCRE-LEAFH Internet #301165224

   We prefer the Calacatta Cressa Leaf. Edge trim will be needed for the exposed ends in the living room and by the pantry window. Seal with a penetrating sealer. I assume the sealed marble can handle heat/steam from stove. Please advise.

5. Remove stub wall beside refrigerator.
6. Move refrigerator cubicle back to front door. Leave room for front
   door-knob.
7. Remove and patch dryer vent in kitchen.
8. Seal and finish irrigation control penetration.
9. Remove and seal current stove exhaust vent. Repair roof at vent location or should we retain the roof exhaust as an attic vent and minimize roof repairs?
10. Add stove vent above new stove location. Small rectangular vent pipe to
   minimize cupboard impact desired.
11. Remove tile floor. Add water-proof flooring similar to BR#1 bamboo to BR#2,
   hall, bath, living room and kitchen. Bamboo flooring is acceptable for
   living room and hall. Include insulating underlayment.
12. Remove extraneous drywall from kitchen. Do we need to replace kitchen
    drywall or just patch, mud and finish?
13. Remove wire raceway in ceiling between kitchen and living room.
14. Fill patch and tape kitchen and living room walls as needed.
15. In living room and BR#2, tape, mud and finish ceiling. Semi-smooth finish.
16. Do we need to cover kitchen, living room and BR#2 ceiling with drywall?
    Currently WW2 era plywood.
17. Do we need to drywall BR#2 walls? Currently WW2 era plywood.
18. The wall insulation is mostly/completely original layered paper from WW2.
    What is the best approach for upgrading the insulation? E.g., inject foam,
    remove siding and insulate, etc. We're planning to re-paint the outside at
    a later time, so that may affect the decision.

### Water Heater

1. Current location is the attic. Remove existing piping as needed and plumb
   new location.
2. Move water heater from attic to outside, between kitchen and bath windows
   appears best.
3. Construct cubicle with insulation and heat tape pipes. May be able to reuse
   heat tape from attic as it was installed December 2017.
4. Include drain pan and relief valve drain line(s), similar to attic
   installation. They can exhaust on to lawn.
5. Replace water heater drain valve with quarter-turn large bore valve. The
   discharge side should be hose-thread to make drain and flush easier.

### Crawl Space

1. Cut concrete footer blocking crawl space access. Enlarge crawl space access.
2. Replace heat tape and insulate pipes as needed. Add additional heat tape to unprotected sections if any.
3. Add/replace under-floor insulation.
4. Do we need to replace the cast-iron drain?

## Doors

### Bedroom #1

1. Raise door jamb close to ceiling.
2. Replace door. Frosted glass or similar synthetic material is desired to allow natural light into hall.

### Bedroom #2

1. Raise door jamb close to ceiling.
2. Replace door with pocket door or barn door. Frosted glass or similar synthetic material is desired to allow natural light into hall.

### Bathroom

1. Raise door jamb close to ceiling.
2. Replace door with pocket door. Frosted glass or similar synthetic material is desired to allow natural light into hall.
3. Add cabinet door for closet.

## Cabinets and Fixtures

### Kitchen

1. Relocate washer water supply to refrigerator cubicle. Remove washer drain.
2. [LÅNGUDDEN Sink, stainless steel](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S89157484/ "LÅNGUDDEN") Article Number: 891.574.84 Size 22 x 20-5/8 inches.
3. [VIMMERN Kitchen faucet with handspray, stainless steel color](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10305289/ "VIMMERN")
4. Add faucet and drain for stove. Drain should be capped for future use by a steam injecting oven. Faucet should have a pull-out nozzle that reaches front of stove for filling large pressure canner. Only cold water plumbing is needed. The kitchen sink faucet design looks workable.
5. Add appliance garage near wine rack for 5-qt Kitchen-Aid mixer, blender and food processor. Garage should have fold away door, so that counter space is accessible when the garage is open.
6. Lower corner cupboard, near sink, should have a lazy susan or pull out shelving so that maximum space can be accessed.
7. Double lower cupboards should have pull out shelves, adjustable height if practical. Sink cupboard should have pull out shelves that work around the plumbing.
8. Spice drawers adjacent to the dishwasher are desired.
9. Installation cutout drawing are available for the dishwasher, stove and refrigerator.
9. Relocate dishwasher and sink per drawing. Update plumbing accordingly.
10. Minimize sink drain obstruction in cabinet.
11. Does the dishwasher need to share a drain with the sink? If not please add a shutoff valve (large bore, quarter turn) for the dishwasher connection to sink drain, so we can plunge the sink drain as needed without backing up into the dishwasher drain line.
12. Relocate dishwasher drain vent.
13. Relocate and replace irrigation control station from kitchen to outside near irrigation valve box. Add electrical supply at new location. It should be un-pluggable or provide a shutoff switch for winter. An associated circuit breaker would work.

### Bathroom

1. Remove old vanity and mirror. Relocate toilet and vanity to wall adjacent to
   window. May want to swap new vanity and toilet location for more clearance.
   However, the shelves next to vanity and cabinets surrounding toilet may
   prevent this. Please advise.
2. Add cabinets and shelves around toilet. Storage for towels, 14 rolls of
   toilet paper and bathroom cleaning supplies.
3. Add shelves adjacent to vanity for electric toothbrushes, hot curler box,
   hair dryer and Braun electric shaver. Hair dryer could be hung from a hook.
4. Retain bath towel bars near current location.
5. Add hand towel rack on side of or adjacent to vanity.
6. New mirror cabinet: [GODMORGON Mirror cabinet with 2 doors](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10218999/ "GODMORGON") Article Number: 102.189.99 Size: 23-5/8 x 5-1/2 x 37-3/4 inches.
7. New sink faucet: [DALSKÄR Bath faucet with strainer, chrome plated](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20281297/ "DALSKÄR") Article Number: 202.812.97 Height: 7-1/8 inches.

Add GODMORGON legs since wall-mount is not likely to be strong enough.
9. Shower head: [HansGrohe Showerhead 260 Square 1-Jet Trim, 2.5 GPM](http://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/articledetail.html?article=26481001&fsid=0x0000713100007511#l=product-recommendation-similar "HansGrohe Showerhead") mounted in the ceiling, in the center of the shower cabinet.
    1. Shower: Surface mounted utility faucet and shower control/diverter that
       can be moved out of the way, when the shower is in use. Should be
       mounted near the door opening, so it can be controlled without reaching
       through the spray. E.g., wall adjacent to kitchen near the corner of the
       shower.
    2. Utility faucet should be high enough to fill a commercial mop bucket
       (~24 inches).
    3. Shower should support in-line water filter, either existing design or
       compatible with new mounting.

### Bedroom #2 (BR#2)

   water supply, drain and dryer vent locations.
