# Walls, Doors, Floors and Cabinets and Fixtures Phase 1

When generating dust from demo, drywall etc., seal the HVAC indoor unit to
protect heat exchanger.

## Walls

1. We're planning to do interior painting ourselves, so any drywall work, etc.
   should leave the walls primer ready. Please leave the floor covered with
   protective paper.
2. Please include baseboard trim, as appropriate, in the rooms where the floor
   is replaced.
3. Remove wall sconces and gang boxes in BR#1 and BR#2. Patch and finish holes.
4. Add backsplash above counter and stove throughout kitchen. Backsplash should
   not extend into Living Room—i.e., around the corner from the kitchen.

   Edge trim will be needed for the exposed ends in the living room and by the
   pantry window.

5. Remove stub wall beside refrigerator.
6. Move refrigerator cubicle back to front door. Leave room for front
   door-knob.
7. Remove and patch dryer vent in kitchen.
8. Remove penetration, seal and finish wall.
9. Remove and seal current stove exhaust vent. Repair roof at vent location or
   should we retain the roof exhaust as an attic vent and minimize roof
   repairs?
10. Add stove vent above new stove location. Small rectangular vent pipe to
    minimize cupboard impact desired.
11. Replace drywall in kitchen.
12. Remove wire raceway in ceiling between kitchen and living room and between
    bathroom and hall. Bathroom ceiling remain unfinished in Phase 1.
13. Fill patch and tape kitchen and living room walls as needed.
14. In living room and BR#2, tape, mud and finish ceiling. Semi-smooth finish.
15. Do we need to cover kitchen, living room and BR#2 ceiling with drywall?
    Currently WW2 era plywood.
16. Do we need to drywall BR#2 walls? Currently WW2 era plywood.

Except for replacing bathroom door with pocket door and removing the raceway,
bathroom changes are [Phase 2](#phase-2-remodel).

### Water Heater Relocation

1. Current location is the attic. Remove existing piping as needed and plumb
   new location.
2. Move water heater from attic to outside; between kitchen and bath windows
   appears best.
3. Construct cubicle with insulation and heat tape pipes. May be able to reuse
   heat tape from attic as it was installed December 2017.
4. Include drain pan and relief valve drain line(s), similar to attic
   installation. Drain pan is new, so can probably be re-used. They can exhaust
   onto lawn. Drain lines should be extendable to allow adding deck or
   screened porch in the future. Hose fittings would work.
5. Replace existing drain valve with large bore quarter turn valve.
   Discharge side should be hose-thread to make drain and flush easier.
6. Re-locate and replace irrigation control inside water heater cubicle.
7. Cubicle floor and door should be elevated to allow addition of deck or
   screened porch in the future.
8. Cubicle and door should be large enough to allow easy removal of the water heater.
9. Water heater access panels, drain, etc. should face the door.

### Crawl Space Plumbing

1. Replace heat tape and insulate pipes as needed. Add additional heat tape to
   unprotected sections if any. Heat tape in crawl space is old, so replace
   with new. Let me know if the lifetime is less than 5 years.
2. Do we need to replace the cast-iron drain? I assume ABS is recommended for
   the drains. Please advise.
3. I assume PEX is the best choice for supply plumbing. Please don't re-use existing
   copper pipe.

## Doors

### Bathroom Door

1. Raise door jamb close to ceiling.
2. Replace door with pocket door. Frosted glass or similar synthetic material
   is desired to allow natural light into hall.

## Floors

Remove tile floor. Add water-proof flooring similar to BR#1 bamboo to
living room and kitchen. Bamboo flooring is acceptable for living room
and hall. Include insulating underlayment.

TAS Bourbon Street Applewood LOLG1039 matches well with BR#1 and current
counter, backsplash and cabinet selections.

## Cabinets and Fixtures

### Kitchen Cabinets and Fixtures

1. For the kitchen counter, we like Latte Quartz from _SBN Marble Granite
   & Tile, Inc._.
2. Relocate washer water supply to refrigerator cubicle. Remove washer drain.

3. [LÅNGUDDEN Sink, stainless steel](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S89157484/ "LÅNGUDDEN")
   Article Number: 891.574.84 Size 22 x 20-5/8 inches.
4. [VIMMERN Kitchen faucet with handspray, stainless steel color](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10305289/ "VIMMERN")
   is installed in the existing kitchen sink. Please re-use the faucet.
   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
5. Add faucet and drain for stove. Drain should be capped for future use by a
   steam injecting oven. Faucet should have a pull-out nozzle that reaches
   front of stove for filling large pressure canner (13 inch height).
   Only cold water plumbing is needed.

6. Add appliance garage near prep. area for 5-qt Kitchen-Aid mixer, blender and
   food processor. Garage should have fold away door, so that counter space is
   accessible when the garage is open.
7. Lower corner cupboard, near sink, should have a lazy-susan or pull out
   shelving so that maximum space can be accessed.
8. Double lower cupboards should have pull out shelves, adjustable height if
   practical. Sink cupboard should have pull out shelves that work around the
   plumbing.
9. Spice drawers adjacent to the dishwasher are desired.
10. Dovetail drawer fronts are desired.
11. Installation cutout drawings are available for the dishwasher, stove and
    refrigerator.

    Size refrigerator cubicle for standard 36 inch; actual refrigerator is
    smaller.

12. Relocate dishwasher and sink per drawing. Update plumbing accordingly.
13. Minimize sink drain obstruction in cabinet. The IKEA plumbing fittings work
    well. Also, the drain guard should be removable: IKEA has a threaded one.
14. The dishwasher drain vent should be located on the counter, behind the
    dishwasher, rather than running into the sink cabinet.
15. The dishwasher supply valve should be accessible, which probably means in
    the sink cabinet. However, it would be nice not to have the dishwasher
    supply hose in the sink cabinet; presumably it can be piped from the valve
    to the dishwasher cabinet.
16. Relocate and replace irrigation control station from kitchen to new water
    heater cubicle.

### Bedroom #2 Cabinets and Fixtures

1. BR#2 will be used as a laundry room and smoking lounge.
2. Add a high flow, very low noise ceiling exhaust fan for controlling humidity
   and exhausting smoke.
3. Add dryer vent
4. Add washer water supply and drain.
5. Installation drawings for washer and dryer are available showing recommended
   water supply, drain and dryer vent locations.
