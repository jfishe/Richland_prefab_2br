# Bathroom Phase 2

- Shower cabinet should be clear _glass/glass-like_ on two sides, facing room,
  and cultured marble on wall sides and pan.
- If not too expensive/challenging, locate the shower drain in the center.
- See [Bathroom Cabinets and Fixtures](#bathroom-cabinets-and-fixtures-phase-2) for
  related details.
- We like cultured marble: Orchard Mexican Sand, light mink, country gray and
  white.
- Replace bathroom walls with drywall or recommend better material. We prefer a
  minimally textured surface.
- Finish and paint bathroom. Sherwin Williams 7002 Downy eggshell would
  match the rest of the house well (we're using flat in the other rooms).
- Does bathroom ceiling need to be replaced or just sand and texture?

## Bathroom Walls Phase 2

## Bathroom Floors Phase 2

Remove tile floor from hallway and bathroom. Add water-proof flooring similar
to BR#1 bamboo to BR#2, hall and bath. Bamboo flooring is acceptable for
living room and hall. Include insulating underlayment.

TAS Bourbon Street Applewood LOLG1039 matches well with BR#1 and current
counter, backsplash and cabinet selections.

## Bathroom Electrical Phase 2

1. Move exhaust fan/light switch to wall adjacent to door. Separate light and
   fan switch into two switches.
2. Ceiling light/exhaust fan may need to be shifted to accommodate shower
   cabinet. Please advise.
3. Add ceiling light over vanity with switch adjacent to vanity.
4. Add duplex outlet adjacent to vanity switch.
5. Add quadraplex outlet on opposite wall to power items on shelves: two
   toothbrushes, Braun shaver and hot curler box.

### Bathroom Cabinets and Fixtures Phase 2

1. Remove old vanity and mirror. Relocate toilet and vanity to wall adjacent to
   window. May want to swap new vanity and toilet location for more clearance.
   However, the shelves next to vanity and cabinets surrounding toilet may
   prevent this. Please advise.
2. Add cabinets and shelves around toilet. Storage for towels, 14 rolls of
   toilet paper and bathroom cleaning supplies.
3. Add shelves adjacent to vanity for electric toothbrushes, hot curler box,
   hair dryer and Braun electric shaver. Hair dryer could be hung from a hook
   or preferably a stainless steel holster. There is room between the sink and
   exterior wall.
4. Retain bath towel bars near current location.
5. Add hand towel rack on side of or adjacent to vanity.

6. New mirror cabinet: [GODMORGON Mirror cabinet with 2 doors](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10218999/ "GODMORGON")
   Article Number: 102.189.99 Size: 23-5/8 x 5-1/2 x 37-3/4 inches.
7. New sink faucet: [DALSKÄR Bath faucet with strainer, chrome plated](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20281297/ "DALSKÄR")
   Article Number: 202.812.97 Height: 7-1/8 inches.
8. New sink: IKEA

   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
   Article Number: 699.032.52 Size 24-3/4 x 19-1/4 x 25 1/4 inches:
   1. Add GODMORGON legs since wall-mount is not likely to be strong enough.
   2. IKEA sink fittings are probably required to avoid interference with the
      GODMORGON drawers
9. Shower head:
   <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
   [HansGrohe Showerhead 260 Square 1-Jet Trim, 2.5 GPM](https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/articledetail-raindance-showerhead-260-square-1-jet-trim-2-5-gpm-26481001 "HansGrohe Showerhead")
   mounted in the ceiling, in the center of the shower cabinet.
   1. Surface mounted utility faucet that can be moved out of the way,
      when the shower is in use. The water supply should tee, so a shower
      diverter is not needed.
   2. Utility faucet Should be mounted near the door opening, so it can be
      controlled without reaching through the spray. E.g., wall adjacent to
      kitchen near the corner of the shower. E.g:
      [Whitehaus WHFS9814-08-C Heavy Duty wall mount utility faucet with an extended swivel spout and lever handles - Polished Chrome](https://www.amazon.com/Whitehaus-WHFS9814-08-C-utility-extended-handles/dp/B00HVJ1AC0/ref=sr_1_8?s=kitchen-bath&ie=UTF8&qid=1535126534&sr=1-8&keywords=wall+mounted+laundry+faucet&refinements=p_n_style_browse-bin%3A542706011)
   3. Utility faucet should be high enough to fill a commercial mop bucket
      (~24 inches).
   4. Shower should support in-line water filter, either existing design,

      or compatible with new mounting.
   5. The shower control should be temperature regulated, e.g.:
