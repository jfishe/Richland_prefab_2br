# Bathroom Phase 2

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

- Shower cabinet should be clear doors and cultured marble on walls and pan.
  - Doors should slide with top rail close to ceiling to maximize
    headroom. Both doors should move to allow access to utility faucet See
    [Bathroom Cabinets and Fixtures](#bathroom-cabinets-and-fixtures-phase-2)
    for related details.
  - We like cultured marble: Orchard Mexican Sand, light mink, country gray and
    white.
- Finish and paint bathroom. Sherwin Williams 7002 Downy Enamel, Emerald
  Interior Acrylic Latex would match the rest of the house well (we're using
  Eggshell in the other rooms).

## Bathroom Walls and Floor Phase 2

- Insulate the floor and walls.
- Replace bathroom walls with drywall or recommend better material. We prefer a
  smooth surface for easy cleaning.
- Replace tile floor with TAS Bourbon Street Applewood LOLG1039. Use leftover
  flooring from Phase 1.
- Replace window. Current window has draining issues due to freezing and algae
  accumulation. Options to estimate:
  - A fixed bottom, vertical sash that drains into the shower.
  - Sealed privacy window.
  - Glass brick.

## Bathroom Electrical Phase 2

- Replace exhaust fan with a quiet, high flow model, similar to BR#2. Fan
  should maximize headroom and use LED lighting.
- Separate light and fan switch into two switches.
- Add recessed lights:
  - Over vanity
  - Over shower, if needed.
  - Lights may share one switch.
- Retain duplex outlet, adjacent to vanity for hair dryer, curling iron etc.
- Add 2x duplex outlets for above toilet shelves.
