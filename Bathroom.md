# Bathroom Phase 2
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

- Shower cabinet should be clear doors and cultured marble on walls and pan.
  - Doors should slide with top rail close to ceiling to maximize
    headroom. Both doors should move to allow access to utility faucet See
    [Bathroom Cabinets and Fixtures](#bathroom-cabinets-and-fixtures-phase-2)
    for related details.
  - We like cultured marble: Orchard Mexican Sand, light mink, country gray and
    white.
- Finish and paint bathroom. Sherwin Williams 7002 Downy Enamel, Emerald
  Interior Acrylic Latex would match the rest of the house well (we're using
  Eggshell in the other rooms).

## Bathroom Walls and Floor Phase 2

- Insulate the floor and walls.
- Replace bathroom walls with drywall or recommend better material. We prefer a
  minimally textured surface.
- Replace tile floor with TAS Bourbon Street Applewood LOLG1039. Use leftover
  flooring from Phase 1.
- Replace window. Current window has draining issues due to freezing and algae
  accumulation. A fixed bottom, vertical sash that drains into the shower or a sealed window is preferred.

## Bathroom Electrical Phase 2

- Replace exhaust fan with a quiet, high flow model, similar to BR#2. Fan
   - should maximize headroom.
- Separate light and fan switch into two switches.
- Add recessed lights:
  - Over vanity
  - Over shower, if needed.
  - Lights may share one switch.
- Replace duplex outlet, adjacent to vanity, with quadraplex outlet.

## Bathroom Cabinets and Fixtures Phase 2

1. Remove old sink and cabinet.
2. Retain mirror cabinet: [GODMORGON Mirror cabinet with 2 doors](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10218999/ "GODMORGON")
   Article Number: 102.189.99 Size: 23-5/8 x 5-1/2 x 37-3/4 inches. Already purchased.
3. Retain rack behind toilet.
4. Retain towel rack near current location.

5. New sink faucet: [DALSKÄR Bath faucet with strainer, chrome plated](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20281297/ "DALSKÄR")
   Article Number: 202.812.97 Height: 7-1/8 inches.
6. New sink: IKEA
   [GODMORGON / ODENSVIK Sink cabinet with 2 drawers, white stained oak white stained oak effect](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S29247322/#/S69903252 "GODMORGON / ODENSVIK")
   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
   Article Number: 699.032.52 Size 24-3/4 x 19-1/4 x 25 1/4 inches:
   1. Add GODMORGON legs since wall-mount is not likely to be strong enough.
   2. IKEA sink fittings are probably required to avoid interference with the
      GODMORGON drawers
7. Shower head:

   [HansGrohe Showerhead 260 Square 1-Jet Trim, 2.5 GPM](https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/articledetail-raindance-showerhead-260-square-1-jet-trim-2-5-gpm-26481001 "HansGrohe Showerhead")
   mounted in the ceiling, in the center of the shower cabinet.
   1. Surface mounted utility faucet that can be moved out of the way,
      when the shower is in use. The water supply should tee, so a shower
      diverter is not needed.
   2. Utility faucet Should be mounted near the door opening, so it can be
      controlled without reaching through the spray. E.g., wall adjacent to
      kitchen near the corner of the shower. E.g:
      [Whitehaus WHFS9814-08-C Heavy Duty wall mount utility faucet with an extended swivel spout and lever handles - Polished Chrome](https://www.amazon.com/Whitehaus-WHFS9814-08-C-utility-extended-handles/dp/B00HVJ1AC0/ref=sr_1_8?s=kitchen-bath&ie=UTF8&qid=1535126534&sr=1-8&keywords=wall+mounted+laundry+faucet&refinements=p_n_style_browse-bin%3A542706011)
   3. Utility faucet should be high enough to fill a commercial mop bucket
      (~24 inches).
   4. Shower should support in-line water filter, either existing design,
      [Sprite Showers Universal Shower Filter in Chrome](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Sprite-Showers-Universal-Shower-Filter-in-Chrome-SL2-CM-R/202386562 "Model # SL2-CM-R Internet #202386562 Store SKU #149467")
      or compatible with new mounting.
   5. The shower control should be temperature regulated, e.g.:

8. Toilet:
   1. Replace with toilet/bidet.
   2. Plumb hot water for bidet.
