# Description

The [home page](https://remodel_richland.droppages.com/) shows the layout
and general idea of the color choices, materials, fittings and furnishings in
a format viewable from modern web browsers (Chrome and Edge have been tested).
[SweetHome 3D Home Plan](Home_Plan.sh3d) contains the native drawing format,
available from the
[Github project site](https://github.com/jfishe/Richland_prefab_2br "jfishe/Richland_prefab_2br").

## Installation

See [Third party notices](#third-party-notices) for the free and open source
software required to view/edit the Home Plan and CAD drawings.

The [`Makefile`][makefile] builds printable PDF's and local HTML5 files with
a javascript viewer of the Sweet Home 3D plan. A Sweet Home 3D plugin is
required to generate the javascript viewer. See
[Third Party Notices](#third-party-notices) for information about downloading
the plugin. Refer to the [`Makefile`][makefile] for build software.

The pdf defaults to `documentclass` article but can be changed to `extarticle`
to allow larger default font sizes.

[makefile]: Makefile
