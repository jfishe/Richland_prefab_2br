# Description

The [home page](https://remodel_richland.droppages.com/) shows the layout
and general idea of the color choices, materials, fittings and furnishings in
a format viewable from modern web browsers (Chrome and Edge have been tested).
[SweetHome 3D Home Plan](Home_Plan.sh3d) contains the native drawing format,
available from the
[Github project site](https://github.com/jfishe/Richland_prefab_2br "jfishe/Richland_prefab_2br").

## Installation

See [Third party notices](#third-party-notices) for the free and open source
software required to view/edit the Home Plan and CAD drawings.

### Build PDF and HTML5

The [`Makefile`][makefile] builds a printable PDF and local HTML5 files with
a JavaScript viewer of the Sweet Home 3d plan. A Sweet Home 3d plugin is
required to generate the JavaScript viewer. See
[Third Party Notices](#third-party-notices) for information about downloading
the plugin. Refer to the [`Makefile`][makefile] for build software.

The PDF defaults to `KOMA-Script` `scrartcl`, specified in
`Richland_Prefab_2BR.mdpp` `YAML` meta-data.

The [`Makefile`][makefile] expects a symbolic link in the local directory to
a Dropbox folder for `remodel_richland.droppages.com`. Update `remodel`
variable in the `Makefile` to change the location.
`htmloutput, staticoutput, templates` and `staticobjects` may also need
adjusting if your static web page server has a different folder layout than
`droppages.com`.

[makefile]: Makefile

### `Droppages.com` Setup

[Droppages.com](http://droppages.com/) provides instructions for setting up
`Dropbox/Apps/My.DropPages/remodel_richland.droppages.com`

To be compatible with Windows 10, generate the symbolic link with something
similar to the Windows `cmd.exe` step below. Start in the directory from which
you cloned this repository.

```{contenteditable="true" spellcheck="false" caption="DOS" .DOS}
mklink /D remodel_richland.droppages.com ^
  %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\Apps\My.DropPages\remodel_richland.droppages.com
```

### Track Changes with PDF Comments

When sharing the PDF, generated by `make pdf` with a contractor, it is helpful
to highlight changes. `difftoolpdf.sh` generates a PDF using PDF comments to
mark changes.

    Usage: difftoolpdf.sh <old> [<new>]

    Old and new can be any commit reference recognized by git checkout.
    E.g., difftoolpdf.sh v1.0 v1.1
    If <new> is ommitted, use the current branch & commit.

Recommend tagging the commit that is shared with the contractor, e.g.,
`git tag v1.0`. Append the commit ID if the tag isn't for the current commit.

### Anaconda or Miniconda

The make file relies on several tools, available through a `conda` environment
specified in [`environment.yml`](environment.yml). To create the necessary
environment, isolated from system versions, `environment.yml` may be used to
create a `conda` environment called `Remodel`.

- [Install Anaconda3 or Miniconda3](https://conda.io/docs/). Pandoc and
  `link_filter.py` were tested using Python 3; they may or may not work in
  Python 2.7.
- From a `bash` prompt, enter `conda env create --file environment.yml`.
- Follow the instructions in the output to `conda activate Remodel`.
