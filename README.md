# Richland Prefab 2BR

The [SweetHome 3D Home Plan](Home_Plan.sh3d) shows the layout and general idea of the color choices, materials, fittings and furnishings. See [Third party notices](#third-party-notices) for the SweetHome 3D free and open source software required to view/edit the Home Plan. The dimensions are close to actual, but there may be discrepancies.

There is some overlap between the [electrical](#electrical) and the other [work](#walls-doors-and-cabinets-and-fixtures). Please let me know where it's confusing and/or redundant and I'll fix.

### Electrical

Lighting, wiring, outlets and irrigation controls are discussed below.

* [Electrical Upgrade](Electrical.md)

### Walls, Doors and Cabinets and Fixtures

Plumbing, flooring, walls, cabinets (kitchen and bath) and fixtures, such as faucets and shower head, are discussed below.
