<p>The following scope covers the completed Phase 1, included for
information.</p>
<h3 id="electrical-upgrade-phase-1">Electrical Upgrade Phase 1</h3>
<h4 id="general">General</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Relocate the breaker box to outside BR#1.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the purlin and patch the hole. Install weatherhead outside
Bedroom #1. Please anchor for high wind to avoid damaging the roof and
causing leaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Relocate cable near breaker box: It currently follows the power
line from the pole in the neighbors yard. A longer run of coaxial cable
is likely needed to reach BR#2. Do you do that or do we need
Charter?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: &lt;14-12-18, John D. Fisher&gt; &gt; Issue #24 Charter
support</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>I assume Charter would not be needed to install the cable
connection inside, but if they’re here for run to the house, I assume it
makes sense to have them finish through the inside.</p></li>
<li><p>We have cats, so arc-fault interrupt circuit breakers seem like a
good idea in case somebody decides to chew on a power cord.</p></li>
<li><p>Much of the wiring is ungrounded. Please replace with grounded
and separate circuits per code. E.g., many of the lighting circuits feed
duplex outlets.</p></li>
<li><p>Surface mounted wiring is acceptable, where necessary, e.g. for
exterior walls.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="bedrooms">Bedrooms</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Remove power from wall sconces in BR#1 and BR#2.</li>
<li>Add LED ceiling lights with dimmer switch, next to the inside door
in BR#1 and BR#2. We like the style of the ones in the kitchen and
living room; I think they’re dimmable. E.g.,

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 --></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="bedroom-1">Bedroom #1</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ground outlets beside bed; outlets are new. Gang boxes may not be up
to code because the drywall was added over them. They are shallow depth
gang boxes. I added extenders to bring flush with drywall.</li>
<li>Add duplex outlet ~4 ft from door on wall adjacent to Living
Room.</li>
<li>Existing ceiling light location has power in attic but is not
connected to switch by door. Please correct.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="bedroom-2">Bedroom #2</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add duplex outlet on outside wall and another on inside wall
(adjacent to bathroom), near the doors.</li>
<li>Add exhaust fan for clothes drying and smoking room—i.e., high flow
and low noise fan.</li>
<li>Add washer and dryer outlets to wall. (near corner of outside
walls).</li>
<li>Add outlet for small chest freezer on corner adjacent to
bathroom.</li>
<li>Remove existing outlet surface mounted in corner adjacent to
bathroom.</li>
<li>Remove and patch cable outlets near inside corner, adjacent to
bathroom. Add cable outlet near ceiling on same wall. Run cable from
breaker box. The cable modem will reside on a shelf near ceiling.</li>
<li>Add duplex outlet near new cable outlet.</li>
<li>Replace light switch with duplex for ceiling light and fan. Note
light switch should support dimmer.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="bathroom-electrical">Bathroom Electrical</h4>
<p>Bathroom remodel is Phase 2. For Phase 1 power existing connections,
which are already grounded.</p>
<h4 id="kitchen-electrical">Kitchen Electrical</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>How should ceiling lights be placed in kitchen? Current location
may not be ideal for open concept floor plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: &lt;14-12-18, John D. Fisher&gt; &gt; Issue #26 and #24 kitchen
ceiling lights</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Check ceiling light gang boxes. They’re surface mounted,
galvanized steel with wire clamps.</p></li>
<li><p>The hood vent has task lighting. We have already purchased a
Zephyr Breeze II Model AK1200W. Refer to the <a href="#walls">Walls</a>
section for details.</p>
<p>Provide an electrical connection for the stove hood vent. See</p>
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<p><a href="#zephyr-breeze">Walls item for the Hood User Manual </a> for
details.</p>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 --></li>
<li><p>Add task lighting to right of sink for preparation area.</p></li>
<li><p>Add switch near preparation area for task lighting.</p></li>
<li><p>Add/replace duplex outlets above counter. We have numerous small
appliances.</p>
<ul>
<li>2x right of sink</li>
<li>1x left of sink</li>
<li>1x right of stove</li>
<li>1x left of stove</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Remove dryer outlet and electrical panel. Seal and finish
penetrations.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove drain for washer and seal drain vent. Drain vents into
attic, so could be sealed from above. Patching may not be required as
the pantry cabinet will likely cover the damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Check/update refrigerator outlet. Note refrigerator wall is being
moved closer to front door, so outlet will require re-wiring.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove existing stove power and relocate to new
location.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="living-room">Living Room</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Replace light switch for ceiling light with dimmer switch.</li>
<li>Check the gang box for the ceiling light. Is it up to code?</li>
<li>Remove defunct gang boxes from walls. Patch walls.</li>
<li>Install a gang box for the Mitsubishi Split; it’s currently in a
hole in the wall. Does code require re-running power instead?</li>
<li>Check/update outlets along walls. There is one near each corner and
one by the hall doorway. All are normal, in-wall outlets.</li>
<li>Add quadraplex outlet for wall mounted TV, near middle of wall
adjacent to BR#1. Retain existing cable outlet. The TV, DVD player,
ink-jet printer and two laptops will share the outlet. The outlet should
support addition of a surround sound in the future–i.e., amplifier plus
seven speakers.</li>
<li>Add floor, quadradplex outlet with cover under coffee table. This is
for laptops (2) when we work from home. The coffee table will transform
into a desk/dining-table. We have ordered the coffee table: <a
href="https://www.spacemaster.co/shop-online/LightWood-Xtable">Transforming
X Coffee and Dining Table in Light Wood Finish (Backordered)</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="outside">Outside</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Check/update outside outlets. The gang boxes may not be correct for
outdoor use.</li>
<li>Change outside outlets to grounded circuits that are not shared with
the interior. They are currently 3-wire, but the ground is not connected
and the wire is routed to one of the outlets in BR#1.</li>
<li>I’m happy with their current locations. Let me know if we’re
required to have more.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="irrigation-electrical">Irrigation Electrical</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Irrigation control will be re-located outside near the crawl space
access. Outlet added for <a href="#crawl-space-electrical">crawl space
heat tape</a> should be near enough to use for irrigation control
station, to be supplied by Owner.</li>
<li>Owner will re-run irrigation valve wires. It is not necessary to
excavate the existing wires from the front garden.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="crawl-space-electrical">Crawl Space Electrical</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add duplex or larger outlet, as needed, to supply heat tape. Outlet
should be near crawl space entrance. It will be used by the <a
href="#irrigation-electrical">irrigation control station</a> during the
summer.</li>
<li>Replace heat tape in crawl space.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="walls-doors-floors-and-cabinets-and-fixtures-phase-1">Walls,
Doors, Floors and Cabinets and Fixtures Phase 1</h3>
<p>When generating dust from demo, drywall etc., seal the HVAC indoor
unit to protect heat exchanger.</p>
<h4 id="walls">Walls</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We’re planning to do interior painting ourselves, so any drywall
work, etc. should leave the walls primer ready. Please leave the floor
covered with protective paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Please include baseboard trim, as appropriate, in the rooms where
the floor is replaced.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove wall sconces and gang boxes in BR#1 and BR#2. Patch and
finish holes.</p></li>
<li><p>Add backsplash above counter and stove throughout kitchen.
Backsplash should not extend into Living Room—i.e., around the corner
from the kitchen.</p>

<li><p>Two magnetic knife strips are mounted on the existing cabinet.
Please mount one each side on the upper cabinets, to either side of the
sink.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace drywall in kitchen.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove wire raceway in ceiling between kitchen and living room
and between bathroom and hall. Bathroom ceiling remain unfinished in
Phase 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill patch and tape kitchen and living room walls as

</ol>
<p>Except for replacing bathroom door with pocket door and removing the
raceway, bathroom changes are <a href="Richland_Prefab_2BR.html">Phase
2</a>.</p>
<h5 id="water-heater-relocation">Water Heater Relocation</h5>
<p>The water heater is behind a truss, which is 7’4” from attic door and
the door is 12 ft. from the front of the house to the nearest edge of
attic door. Dimensions are from the exterior of the house. The
approximate location has been added to <a
href="Richland_Prefab_2BR.html">the View Home button</a>.</p>
<p>Since there is adequate clearance for the hood vent over the stove,
the water heater does not need to be relocated.</p>
<h5 id="crawl-space-plumbing">Crawl Space Plumbing</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>Replace heat tape and insulate pipes as needed. Add additional heat
tape to unprotected sections if any. Heat tape in crawl space is old, so
replace with new. Let me know if the lifetime is less than 5 years.</li>
<li>Do we need to replace the cast-iron drain? I assume ABS is
recommended for the drains. Please advise.</li>
<li>I assume PEX is the best choice for supply plumbing. Please don’t
reuse existing copper pipe.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="doors">Doors</h4>
<h5 id="bathroom-door">Bathroom Door</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>Raise door jamb close to ceiling.</li>
<li>Replace door with pocket door. Similar to <a
href="https://www.simpsondoor.com/find-a-door/?view=detail&amp;doorType=&amp;BaseSpecificationID=542#DoorDetail">Simpson

</ol>
<h4 id="floors">Floors</h4>
<p>Remove tile floor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kitchen</li>
<li>Living Room</li>
<li>Hallway</li>
<li>Bedroom #2</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not remove floor in Bathroom, which is deferred to <a
href="Richland_Prefab_2BR.html">Phase 2</a>.</p>
<p>Add water-resistant flooring similar to BR#1 bamboo to living room
and kitchen. Bamboo flooring is acceptable for living room and hall.
Include insulating underlayment.</p>
<p>TAS Bourbon Street Applewood LOLG1039 matches well with BR#1 and
current counter, backsplash and cabinet selections.</p>
<h4 id="cabinets-and-fixtures">Cabinets and Fixtures</h4>
<h5 id="kitchen-cabinets-and-fixtures">Kitchen Cabinets and
Fixtures</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For the kitchen counter, we like Latte Quartz from <em>SBN Marble
Granite &amp; Tile, Inc.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Relocate washer water supply to refrigerator cubicle. Remove
washer drain.</p></li>
<li><p>We have purchased the <a

Sink, stainless steel</a>.</p>
<p>Please return to owner, the assembly tools provided with the
NORRSJÖN.</p>
<p>The sink includes fittings necessary for top mounting. Top mounting
is needed to be compatible with drawer height in the sink cabinet. The
drawers will include horse-shoe shaped shelves to accommodate
plumbing.</p>
<p>Coordinate with cabinet maker and plumber. The sink also includes the
drain fittings but does not include pipe and fittings needed to connect
the drain line. The existing piping is setup for two sink drains and a
dishwasher drain; the new sink has only one.</p>
