# Third Party Notices

* The floor plan drawings include dimensions from @columbiaabc. They have not
  placed a copyright notice on the book.
* [Store markdown documentation in the same folder as code, run this script,
  get html documentation in a dedicated folder][md_htmldoc] was adapted for
  convenient conversion of markdown to HTML5.
* [LibreCAD][librecad] was used to create the 2D drawings.
* [Sweet Home 3D][sweethome3d] was used to develop the interior layout and fixtures.
  - Use [Export to HTML5 plug-in][HTML5_plug] to export Home_Plan.zip, which the
    Makefile uses to build HTML5 from the Markdown files.
