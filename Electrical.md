# Electrical Upgrade Phase 1

## General

1. Relocate the breaker box to outside BR#1.
2. Remove the purlin and patch the hole. Install weatherhead outside Bedroom
   #1. Please anchor for high wind to avoid damaging the roof and causing
   leaks.
3. Relocate cable near breaker box: It currently follows the power line from
   the pole in the neighbors yard. A longer run of coaxial cable is likely
   needed to reach BR#2. Do you do that or do we need Charter?

   > TODO: <14-12-18, John D. Fisher> > Issue #24 Charter support

4. I assume Charter would not be needed to install the cable connection inside,
   but if they're here for run to the house, I assume it makes sense to have
   them finish through the inside.
5. We have cats, so arc-fault interrupt circuit breakers seem like a good idea
   in case somebody decides to chew on a power cord.
6. Much of the wiring is ungrounded. Please replace with grounded and separate
   circuits per code. E.g., many of the lighting circuits feed duplex outlets.
7. Surface mounted wiring is acceptable, where necessary, e.g. for exterior
   walls.

## Bedrooms

1. Remove power from wall sconces in BR#1 and BR#2.
2. Add LED ceiling lights with dimmer switch, next to the inside door in
   BR#1 and BR#2. We like the style of the ones in the kitchen and living room;
   I think they're dimmable. E.g.,

   [13 in. 180-Watt Equivalent Brushed Nickel Integrated LED Flushmount with Frosted Glass Shade (2-Pack)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-13-in-180-Watt-Equivalent-Brushed-Nickel-Integrated-LED-Flushmount-with-Frosted-Glass-Shade-2-Pack-JAL8011L-BN/206814821 "Commercial Electric").
   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

### Bedroom #1

1. Ground outlets beside bed; outlets are new. Gang boxes may not be up to code
   because the drywall was added over them. They are shallow depth gang boxes.
   I added extenders to bring flush with drywall.
2. Add duplex outlet ~4 ft from door on wall adjacent to Living Room.
3. Existing ceiling light location has power in attic but is not connected to
   switch by door. Please correct.

### Bedroom #2

1. Add duplex outlet on outside wall and another on inside wall
   (adjacent to bathroom), near the doors.
2. Add exhaust fan for clothes drying and smoking roomâ€”i.e., high flow and low
   noise fan.
3. Add washer and dryer outlets to wall. (near corner of outside walls).
4. Add outlet for small chest freezer on corner adjacent to bathroom.
5. Remove existing outlet surface mounted in corner adjacent to bathroom.
6. Remove and patch cable outlets near inside corner, adjacent to bathroom. Add
   cable outlet near ceiling on same wall. Run cable from breaker box. The
   cable modem will reside on a shelf near ceiling.
7. Add duplex outlet near new cable outlet.
8. Replace light switch with duplex for ceiling light and fan. Note light
   switch should support dimmer.

## Bathroom Electrical

Bathroom remodel is Phase 2. For Phase 1 power existing connections, which are
already grounded.

## Kitchen Electrical

1. How should ceiling lights be placed in kitchen? Current location may not be
   ideal for open concept floor plan.

   > TODO: <14-12-18, John D. Fisher> > Issue #26 and #24 kitchen ceiling
   > lights

2. Check ceiling light gang boxes. They're surface mounted, galvanized steel
   with wire clamps.
3. The hood vent has task lighting. We have already purchased a Zephyr Breeze
   II Model AK1200W. Refer to the [Walls](#walls) section for details.

   Provide an electrical connection for the stove hood vent. See

   <!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

   <a href="#zephyr-breeze">Walls item \ref{zephyr-breeze} for the Hood User Manual
   </a> for details.

   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

4. Add task lighting to right of sink for preparation area.
5. Add switch near preparation area for task lighting.
6. Add/replace duplex outlets above counter. We have numerous small appliances.
   - 2x right of sink
   - 1x left of sink
   - 1x right of stove
   - 1x left of stove
7. Remove dryer outlet and electrical panel. Seal and finish penetrations.
8. Remove drain for washer and seal drain vent. Drain vents into attic, so
   could be sealed from above. Patching may not be required as the pantry
   cabinet will likely cover the damage.
9. Check/update refrigerator outlet. Note refrigerator wall is being moved
   closer to front door, so outlet will require re-wiring.
10. Remove existing stove power and relocate to new location.

## Living Room

1. Replace light switch for ceiling light with dimmer switch.
2. Check the gang box for the ceiling light. Is it up to code?
3. Remove defunct gang boxes from walls. Patch walls.
4. Install a gang box for the Mitsubishi Split; it's currently in a hole in the
   wall. Does code require re-running power instead?
5. Check/update outlets along walls. There is one near each corner and one
   by the hall doorway. All are normal, in-wall outlets.
6. Add quadraplex outlet for wall mounted TV, near middle of wall adjacent to
   BR#1. Retain existing cable outlet. The TV, DVD player, ink-jet printer and
   two laptops will share the outlet. The outlet should support addition of
   a surround sound in the future--i.e., amplifier plus seven speakers.
7. Add floor, quadradplex outlet with cover under coffee table. This is for
   laptops (2) when we work from home. The coffee table will transform into a
   desk/dining-table. We have ordered the coffee table:
   [Transforming X Coffee and Dining Table in Light Wood Finish (Backordered)](https://www.spacemaster.co/shop-online/LightWood-Xtable).

## Outside

1. Check/update outside outlets. The gang boxes may not be correct for
   outdoor use.
2. Change outside outlets to grounded circuits that are not shared with the
   interior. They are currently 3-wire, but the ground is not connected and the
   wire is routed to one of the outlets in BR#1.
3. I'm happy with their current locations. Let me know if we're required to
   have more.

## Irrigation Electrical

1. Irrigation control will be re-located outside near the crawl space access.
   Outlet added for [crawl space heat tape](#crawl-space-electrical) should be
   near enough to use for irrigation control station, to be supplied by Owner.
2. Owner will re-run irrigation valve wires. It is not necessary to excavate
   the existing wires from the front garden.

## Crawl Space Electrical

1. Add duplex or larger outlet, as needed, to supply heat tape. Outlet should
   be near crawl space entrance. It will be used by the
   [irrigation control station](#irrigation-electrical) during the summer.
2. Replace heat tape in crawl space.
