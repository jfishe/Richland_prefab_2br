# Electrical Upgrade

## General

1. Relocate the breaker box to outside BR#1.
2. Remove the purlin and patch the hole. Install weatherhead outside Bedroom #1.
3. Relocate cable near breaker box. Do you do that or do we need Charter?
4. I assume Charter will be needed to install the cable connection inside.
5. Will the breaker box contain GFCI circuit breakers? For all lines or
   just rooms with sinks?

## Bedrooms (BR#1 and BR#2)

1. Remove power from wall sconces in BR#1 and BR#2.
2. Add LED ceiling lights with dimmer switch, next to the inside door in
   BR#1 and BR#2.

### Bedroom #1 (BR#1)

1. Ground outlets beside bed; outlets are new. Gang boxes may not be up to code.
2. Add duplex outlet near right side of window.
3. Add duplex outlet ~4 ft from door on wall adjacent to Living Room.

### Bedroom #2 (BR#2)

1. Add duplex outlet on outside wall (by back door) and another on inside wall
   (adjacent to bathroom), near the doors.
2. The exterior wall may be deep enough for a normal outlet. The
   interior walls will likely need to be surface mounted.
3. Add exhaust fan for clothes drying and smoking roomâ€”i.e., high flow and low
   noise fan. May be able to share roof vent with bathroom, but should avoid
   back-drafting smoke into bathroom.
4. Add dryer exhaust vent to wall. Add washer and dryer outlets to wall. (near
   corner of outside walls)
5. Add outlet for small chest freezer on corner adjacent to bathroom.
6. Remove and patch cable outlets near inside corner, adjacent to bathroom. Add
   cable outlet near ceiling on same wall. Run cable from breaker box. The
   cable modem will reside on a shelf near ceiling. Add duplex outlet near new
   cable outlet.
7. Replace inside door with barn door or pocket door. Wall depth may be
   sufficient for pocket door.

## Bathroom

1. Move toilet and vanity to wall adjacent to window. May want to swap new
   vanity and toilet location for more clearance. However, the shelves next to
   vanity and cabinets surrounding toilet may prevent this. Please advise.
2. Move exhaust fan/light switch to wall adjacent to door. Separate light and
   fan switch into two switches.
3. Add ceiling light over vanity with switch adjacent to vanity.
4. Add duplex outlet adjacent to vanity switch.
5. Add duplex outlet on opposite wall to power items on shelves.
6. Replace door with pocket door.

## Kitchen

1. How should ceiling lights be placed in kitchen? Current location may not be
   ideal for open concept floor plan.
2. The hood vent has task lighting.
3. Add task lighting to right of sink for prep. area.
4. Add/replace duplex outlets above counter. We have numerous small applicances.
5. Remove dryer outlet and electrical panel.
6. Remove drain for washer.
7. Check/update refrigerator outlet.
8. Add outlet for TV on wall outside refrigerator nook.
9. Relocate sprinkler control to outside, near sprinkler valve box.

## Living Room

1. Check/update light switch for ceiling light.
2. Check the gang box for the ceiling light. Is it up to code?
4. Remove defunct gang boxes from walls. Patch walls.
5. Install a gang box for the Mitsubishi Split; it's currently in a hole in the
   wall. Does code require re-running power?
6. Check/update outlets along walls. There is one near each corner and one
   by the hall doorway. All are normal, in-wall outlets.
7. Add outlet for wall mounted TV, near middle of wall adjacent to BR#1.

## Outside

1. Check/update outside outlets. The gang boxes do not look correct for
   outdoor use. 
2. Change outside outlets to grounded circuits that are not shared with the
   interior. They are currently 3-wire, but the ground is not connected.
3. I'm happy with their current locations. Let me know if we're required to
   have more.

## Water Heater

1. Move water heater from attic to outside.
2. Construct cubicle with insulation and heat tape.
