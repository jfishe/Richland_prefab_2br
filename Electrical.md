# Electrical Upgrade

## General

1. Relocate the breaker box to outside BR#1.
2. Remove the purlin and patch the hole. Install weatherhead outside Bedroom #1. Please anchor for high wind to avoid damaging the roof and causing leaks.
3. Relocate cable near breaker box: It currently follows the power line from
   the pole in the neighbors yard. A longer run of coaxial cable is likely
   needed to reach BR#2. Do you do that or do we need Charter?
4. I assume Charter would not be needed to install the cable connection inside,
   but if they're here for run to the house, I assume it makes sense to have
   them finish through the inside.
5. Will the breaker box contain GFCI circuit breakers? For all lines or
   just rooms with sinks?
6. We have cats, so arc-fault interrupt circuit breakers seem like a good idea
   in case somebody decides to chew on a power cord. Did I use the right
   terminology?
7. Much of the wiring is ungrounded. Please replace with grounded and separate circuits per code. E.g., many of the lighting circuits feed duplex outlets.
8. What do recommend for storing household dishes and furniture during construction—i.e., from whom should we rent a storage pod?

## Bedrooms (BR#1 and BR#2)

1. Remove power from wall sconces in BR#1 and BR#2.
2. Add LED ceiling lights with dimmer switch, next to the inside door in
   BR#1 and BR#2. We like the style of the ones in the kitchen and living room; I think they're dimmable. E.g., [13 in. 180-Watt Equivalent Brushed Nickel Integrated LED Flushmount with Frosted Glass Shade (2-Pack)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-13-in-180-Watt-Equivalent-Brushed-Nickel-Integrated-LED-Flushmount-with-Frosted-Glass-Shade-2-Pack-JAL8011L-BN/206814821 "Commercial Electric").

### Bedroom #1 (BR#1)

1. Ground outlets beside bed; outlets are new. Gang boxes may not be up to code because the drywall was added over them. They are shallow depth gang boxes. I added extenders to bring flush with drywall.
2. Add duplex outlet near right side of window.
3. Add duplex outlet ~4 ft from door on wall adjacent to Living Room.
4. Existing ceiling light location has power in attic but is not connected to switch by door. Please correct.

### Bedroom #2 (BR#2)

1. Add duplex outlet on outside wall and another on inside wall
   (adjacent to bathroom), near the doors.
2. The exterior wall may be deep enough for a normal outlet. The
   interior walls will likely need to be surface mounted.
3. Add exhaust fan for clothes drying and smoking room—i.e., high flow and low
   noise fan. May be able to share roof vent with bathroom, but should avoid
   back-drafting smoke into bathroom.
4. Add washer and dryer outlets to wall. (near corner of outside walls).
5. Add outlet for small chest freezer on corner adjacent to bathroom.
6. Remove existing outlet surface mounted in corner adjacent to bathroom.
7. Remove and patch cable outlets near inside corner, adjacent to bathroom. Add
   cable outlet near ceiling on same wall. Run cable from breaker box. The
   cable modem will reside on a shelf near ceiling.
8. Add duplex outlet near new cable outlet.
9. Replace light switch with duplex for ceiling light and fan. Note light
   switch should support dimmer.

## Bathroom

1. Move exhaust fan/light switch to wall adjacent to door. Separate light and
   fan switch into two switches.
2. Ceiling light/exhaust fan may need to be shifted to accommodate shower
   cabinet. Please advise.
3. Add ceiling light over vanity with switch adjacent to vanity.
4. Add duplex outlet adjacent to vanity switch.
5. Add quadraplex outlet on opposite wall to power items on shelves: two toothbrushes, Braun shaver and hot curler box.

## Kitchen

1. How should ceiling lights be placed in kitchen? Current location may not be
   ideal for open concept floor plan.
2. Check ceiling light gang boxes. They're surface mounted, galvanized steel with wire clamps.
3. The hood vent has task lighting. We already have a hood vent.
4. Add task lighting to right of sink for preparation area. Is under-cabinet the best choice?
5. Add switch near preparation area for task lighting.
6. Add/replace duplex outlets above counter. We have numerous small appliances.
7. Remove dryer outlet and electrical panel. Seal and finish penetrations.
8. Remove drain for washer and seal drain vent. Drain vents into attic, so could be sealed from above. Patching may not be required as the pantry cabinet will likely cover the damage.
9. Check/update refrigerator outlet. Note refrigerator wall is being move
   closer to front door, so outlet will require re-wriring.
10. Add outlet for TV on wall outside refrigerator cubicle.
11. Remove existing stove power and relocate to new location.

## Living Room

1. Replace light switch for ceiling light with dimmer switch.
2. Check the gang box for the ceiling light. Is it up to code?
3. Remove defunct gang boxes from walls. Patch walls.
4. Install a gang box for the Mitsubishi Split; it's currently in a hole in the
   wall. Does code require re-running power instead?
5. Check/update outlets along walls. There is one near each corner and one
   by the hall doorway. All are normal, in-wall outlets.
6. Add duplex outlet for wall mounted TV, near middle of wall adjacent to BR#1. Retain
   existing cable outlet. The TV, DVD player, ink-jet printer and two laptops will share the outlet. The outlet should support addition of a surround sound in the future--i.e., amplifier plus seven speakers.
7. Add floor, quadradplex outlet with cover under coffee table. This is for
   laptops (2) when we work from home. The coffee table will transform into a
   desk/dining-table. We have ordered the coffee table: [Transforming X Coffee and Dining Table in Light Wood Finish (Backordered)](https://www.spacemaster.co/shop-online/LightWood-Xtable).

## Outside

1. Check/update outside outlets. The gang boxes may not be correct for
   outdoor use.
2. Do we need to increase the amperage for shop tools, like a table saw? I
   don't plan to run multiple tools at once. Existing circuits have not been a
   problem.
3. Change outside outlets to grounded circuits that are not shared with the
   interior. They are currently 3-wire, but the ground is not connected.
4. I'm happy with their current locations. Let me know if we're required to
   have more.

## Water Heater

1. Move water heater from attic to outside.
2. Add power for the water heater and heat tape.
3. Attic heat tape is new and may be re-used.
4. Irrigation control will be located in the water heater cubicle. Add
   electrical supply at new location. It should be un-pluggable or provide a
   shutoff switch for winter. An associated circuit breaker would work.
5. Re-run irrigation valve wires from valve box to cubicle. It is not necessary
   to excavate the existing wires from the front garden.


## Crawl Space

1. Add duplex or larger outlet, as needed, to supply heat tape. Outlet should be near crawl space entrance.
2. Replace heat tape in crawl space.
3. [Walls, Doors and Cabinets and Fixtures](Walls_Doors_Cabinets.md) is addressing pipe and floor insulation.
