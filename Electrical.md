# Electrical Upgrade

## General

1. Relocate the breaker box to outside Bedroom #1.
2. Relocate the purlin to the opposite side of the house. Can we switch to
   a pole with a weatherhead instead of purlin?
3. The cable appears to come in on the power line, so I assume we'll have
   to relocate that with the purlin. Do you do that or do we need Charter?
4. I assume Charter will be needed to install the cable connection inside.
5. Will the breaker box contain GFCI circuit breakers? For all lines or
   just rooms with sinks?

## Bedrooms (BR#1 and BR#2)

1. Remove power from wall sconces in BR#1 and BR#2.
2. Add LED ceiling lights with dimmer switch, next to the inside door in
   BR#1 and BR#2.

### Bedroom #1 (BR#1)

1. Check/update outlets beside bed; they are not currently grounded.
2. Add outlet near the door.
3. Add outlet in corner, beside the closet.

### Bedroom #2 (BR#2)

1. Add two surface mounted outlets, about 4 ft. from closet door, one
   low and one about 3 ft. The TV will be mounted on this wall with
   shelves below.
2. Add two outlets on outside wall (by back door) and inside wall (adjacent
   to bathroom), one pair near the doors and the other near the corners.
3. The exterior wall may be deep enough for a normal outlet. The
   interior walls will likely need to be surface mounted.
4. Add exhaust fan for clothes drying and smoking room. 

## Kitchen

1. How should ceiling lights be placed in kitchen?
2. The hood vent has task lighting. Should we include task lighting for the
   counter space?
3. Relocate Dryer outlet to about 4 ft on wall behind Washer. We intend to
   stack the Washer and Dryer. The wall appears deep enough for a normal
   outlet.
4. Update wired outlet in cupboard above stove for hood vent with normal,
   in-wall  wired connection for hood vent. Leave sufficient wire to
   connect to hood vent.
5. Update Stove/Oven outlet. Change to normal in-wall outlet.
6. Check/update outlet behind dishwasher. It is currently a normal,
   in-wall, wired outlet.
7. Remove power from outlet directly above stove.
8. Add a surface mounted, power strip above counter height along wall
   adjacent to bathroom. I assume 12 inch spacing is OK. This is for
   connecting small appliances; let me know the maximum amperage. We want
   convenience locations, not large load.
9. Check/update refrigerator outlet.
10. Check/update outlet in half-height partition wall.

## Living Room

1. Check/update light switch for ceiling light. Add a second switch for
   a ceiling light in the corner.
2. Check the gang box for the ceiling light. Is it up to code?
3. Add a gang box for a ceiling light in corner between windows. This is
   smaller light for a desk going there.
4. Remove defunct gang boxes from walls. Patch walls; we'll paint.
5. Install a gang box for the Mitsubishi Split; it's currently in a hole in the wall.
6. Check/update outlets along walls. There is one near each corner and one
   by the hall doorway. All are normal, in-wall outlets.
7. Add normal, in-wall outlets near front door, one on each side of the
   door. There is an ungrounded outlet currently on one side; it should be
   updated.

## Outside

1. Check/update outside outlets. The gang boxes do not look correct for
   outdoor use.
2. Change outside outlets to grounded circuits that are not shared with the
   interior. They are currently 3-wire, but the ground is not connected.
3. I'm happy with their current locations. Let me know if we're required to
   have more.
